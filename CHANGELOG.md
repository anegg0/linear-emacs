# Changelog

All notable changes to linear-emacs will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-20

### Initial Release

Linear-emacs is an Emacs/Linear.app integration package to manage Linear issues without leaving Emacs (or close).

### Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Full Linear API Integration**: Interact with Linear's GraphQL API directly from Emacs
- **Issue Management**: List, view, and create Linear issues without leaving Emacs
- **Team Support**: Select teams, view team members, and manage team-specific workflows
- **Rich Issue Creation**: Create issues with titles, descriptions, priorities, assignees, estimates, and labels
- **Workflow State Management**: Support for all Linear workflow states (Todo, In Progress, In Review, Backlog, Blocked, Done)

#### Org-Mode Integration
- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Sync between Linear.app and org-mode
- **TODO State Mapping**: Automatic mapping between Linear workflow states and org-mode TODO states
- **Live Updates**: Changes in org-mode automatically propagate to Linear (and vice versa)
- **Filtering**: Only syncs active issues (excludes completed issues for better focus)
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Background synchronization for improved performance

#### User Experience
- **Secure API Key Management**: Support for environment variables and auth-source integration
- **Customizable Output**: Configure where Linear issues are stored in your org directory
- **Debug Mode**: Built-in debugging for troubleshooting API interactions
- **Pagination Support**: Handles large numbers of issues
- **Priority Mapping**: Maps Linear priorities to org-mode priorities (Urgent‚ÜíA, High‚ÜíB, Medium‚ÜíC, Low‚ÜíD)
