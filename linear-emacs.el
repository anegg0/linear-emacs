;; This file is organized into the following sections:
;;
;; - Dependencies and requirements
;; - Customization and variables
;; - Core API functions
;; - Team management functions
;; - Issue management functions
;; - Issue state management functions
;; - Org-mode integration functions
;; - Mapping functions (between Linear and org-mode)
;; - User-facing commands
;; - Org-mode sync hooks
